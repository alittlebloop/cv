    <h1>What Makes My Mind Tick?</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Traveling the world - both in my dreams and not, that is, Earth</li>
      <li>Communicating with people, especially children, because learning about different mindsets and opinions makes me excited to go along my day. <br>Children offers the most insightful ideas, in my humble opinion, and that in turn inspires me.
      </li>
      <li>Learning languages - currently taking on Japanese at Japanese Cultural Society Singapore</li>
      <li>Reading - anything that makes my mind wander</li>
